TODO for Feb 12th 
- we need to add dynamic behavior to our website
- we want the smallest increment of functionality
- lambda function
    input - list of ingredients
    output - a recipe that is in the system and uses only the specified ingredients
- simple solution
    lambda can output one recipe always that is not in the database




TODO for Feb 6th
- upload to aws our current local version
- from main page be able to go to a recipe page (from the recipe table)
- upload again latest version
- update site blog about checkbox
- also update about syncing local version webpage to public internet.

TODO  for Mar 19th
- understand react: how is it different than static html, how to create a component
- create a react component for the ingredients table and use it in my-app

Next steps
- make the API be dynamic based on the selected ingredients, but the recipes are still in the code
- make it read data from database instead of lambda code
- upload recipes
- make it pretty
